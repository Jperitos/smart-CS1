- **Alerts**: Red-themed card showing critical alerts and warnings  
- **Maintenance**: Blue-themed card showing maintenance tasks
- **Route Changes**: Purple-themed card showing route and schedule updates

### 2. Dynamic Activity Statistics
- Real-time calculation of activity statistics
- Auto-refresh every 30 seconds
- Statistics based on today's activities
- Proper categorization of different activity types

### 3. Enhanced Activity Logs Table
- Fully functional table with database connection
- Advanced filtering and sorting capabilities
- Color-coded badges for activity types, status, and priority
- Responsive design with mobile card view
- Search functionality across multiple fields

## 🔧 New API Endpoints

### GET /api/activity-stats
Returns activity statistics for today's overview cards.

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "stats": {
    "collections": 1,
    "alerts": 2,
    "maintenance": 2,
    "routeChanges": 1,
    "totalActivities": 5,
    "date": "2025-09-26",
    "lastUpdated": "2025-09-26T15:22:16.062Z"
  },
  "activities": [...]
}
```

### GET /api/activity-stats/range?startDate=YYYY-MM-DD&endDate=YYYY-MM-DD
Returns activity statistics for a specific date range.

## 🎨 UI Components

### ActivityOverviewCards Component
- Displays four color-coded cards
- Shows loading states
- Responsive grid layout
- Hover effects and transitions

### EnhancedActivityLogs Component
- Combines overview cards with activity logs table
- Advanced filtering system
- Real-time data updates
- Error handling and loading states

## 🔄 Data Flow

1. **Statistics Calculation**: Server calculates statistics from Firestore activity logs
2. **Real-time Updates**: Client polls statistics every 30 seconds
3. **Table Data**: Activity logs fetched with pagination and filtering
4. **State Management**: React hooks manage loading, error, and data states

## 🎯 Activity Type Categorization

### Collections
- `collection`
- `task_assignment`
- `bin_collection`
- `bin_emptied`

### Alerts
- `bin_alert`
- `alert`
- `bin_status: 'critical'` or `'warning'`
- `priority: 'high'` or `'urgent'`

### Maintenance
- `maintenance`
- `repair`
- `cleaning`

### Route Changes
- `route_change`
- `schedule_update`
- `route_update`

## 🚀 Usage

### For Developers
1. The enhanced Activity Logs are automatically integrated into the Admin Dashboard
2. Navigate to the Activity tab to see the new features
3. Statistics update automatically every 30 seconds
4. Use the filtering options to narrow down activity logs

### For Testing
1. Start the server: `npm start` in the server directory
2. The client will automatically connect to the new endpoints
3. Sample data can be added to Firestore for testing

## 🔧 Configuration

### Auto-refresh Interval
The statistics auto-refresh interval can be configured in the `useActivityStats` hook:
```typescript
const { stats, overviewCards, loading, error, refetch } = useActivityStats(30000); // 30 seconds
```

### Statistics Endpoint
The statistics endpoint can be customized in `activityStatsController.js` to include additional metrics or change categorization logic.

## 📱 Responsive Design

- **Desktop**: Full table view with all columns
- **Mobile**: Card-based layout with essential information
- **Tablet**: Adaptive layout that switches between table and cards

## 🎨 Color Scheme

- **Collections**: Green (`text-green-600`, `bg-green-100`)
- **Alerts**: Red (`text-red-600`, `bg-red-100`)
- **Maintenance**: Blue (`text-blue-600`, `bg-blue-100`)
- **Route Changes**: Purple (`text-purple-600`, `bg-purple-100`)

## 🔍 Error Handling

- Graceful fallback when statistics endpoint fails
- Loading states for all async operations
- Error messages displayed to users
- Automatic retry mechanisms

## 📊 Performance Considerations

- Statistics are calculated server-side to reduce client load
- Pagination implemented for large datasets
- Debounced search to prevent excessive API calls
- Efficient Firestore queries with proper indexing

## 🧪 Testing

The implementation includes:
- Sample data generation for testing
- Comprehensive error handling
- Loading state management
- Responsive design testing

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
1. Real-time WebSocket updates for instant statistics
2. Export functionality for activity logs
3. Advanced analytics and reporting
4. Custom date range selection
5. Activity log archiving system

## 📝 Notes

- The implementation maintains backward compatibility with existing activity logs
- All new features are opt-in and don't affect existing functionality
- The code is organized following React and Node.js best practices
- Comprehensive error handling ensures system stability
